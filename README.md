## 📖 Project Overview

**EduSync** is a sophisticated Smart Academic Scheduler designed to eliminate the logistical nightmare of manual timetable creation in educational institutions. By leveraging a powerful constraint-satisfaction logic, EduSync automates the generation of conflict-free weekly schedules.

The platform balances multiple complex variables—including teacher availability, room capacities, and specific course requirements—to ensure an optimized learning environment for students and an organized workflow for faculty.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛠️ Comprehensive Resource Management
Full-scale CRUD capabilities for the core pillars of the institution:
- **Batches**: Manage student cohorts and their academic years.
- **Courses**: Define subjects, credit hours, and prerequisite requirements.
- **Teachers**: Maintain detailed faculty profiles and specializations.
- **Rooms**: Manage physical infrastructure, including lecture halls and specialized labs.

### 📅 Intelligent Teacher Availability
No more scheduling conflicts. Teachers can define their specific "Available Slots" for each day of the week, ensuring that the system only assigns classes when the instructor is actually available.

### 🏛️ Resource Optimization
The system doesn't just find a room; it finds the *right* room. EduSync matches course requirements (e.g., "Chemistry Lab" or "Seminar Hall") with room capacities and available facilities to maximize space utilization.

### ⚙️ The EduSync Engine
The heart of the application. A powerful automated scheduling algorithm that processes all constraints to generate a conflict-free timetable in seconds, drastically reducing administrative overhead.

### 🖨️ Export & Distribution
Generate professional, clean, and full-page schedules ready for physical posting or digital sharing. The system includes optimized "Print Views" that automatically strip away interface clutter for a high-fidelity export.

### 🔄 Real-time Synchronization
Powered by **Socket.io**, EduSync ensures that all stakeholders—admins, teachers, and students—see updates the instant they happen. No manual refreshing is required when a schedule is published or modified.

### 🎨 Premium User Experience
- **Sleek Dashboard**: A modern, responsive administrative interface built with **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Intuitive Icons**: Integrated **Lucide React** icons for a professional, clean aesthetic.
- **Seamless State**: Powered by **Redux Toolkit (RTK) Query** for real-time server-state synchronization and lightning-fast data fetching.
